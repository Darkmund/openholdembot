v1.0.2 2007-10-16
-----------------
NEW STUFF:
- Button to lock blinds.
- Added new symbol "version", that returns current version number of OpenHoldem.
- GWS calls from a DLL can now be of arbitrary complexity.  We don't know exactly what use this is, but it's
  cool nontheless.  And open source is all about "cool", so deal with it.  Example:
  DLL code:
  double process_query( const char* pquery ) {
	if (pquery==NULL)
		return 0;

	if (strncmp(pquery,"dll$test",8)==0)
		return gws("random");

	if (strncmp(pquery,"dll$spend",9)==0)
		return gws("f$spend");

	if (strncmp(pquery,"dll$recurse",11)==0)
		return gws("dll$mynumber");

	if (strncmp(pquery,"dll$mynumber",12)==0)
		return 12345.67;

	if (strncmp(pquery,"dll$complex",11)==0)
		return gws("f$spend/25 * 1.1");

	return 0;
  }
